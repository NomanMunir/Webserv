Step-by-Step CGI Execution Flow
CGI Request Recognition

Your server identifies a request that requires CGI handling based on the request URI or file extension (e.g., .cgi, .pl).
Environment Setup

Populate environment variables with information about the request.
Executing the CGI Script

Fork a new process.
Set up input/output for the CGI script.
Interprocess Communication

The parent process handles the client connection.
The child process executes the CGI script.
Handling Script Output

Read and parse the script's output.
Send headers and content back to the client.


Summary
Recognize CGI Requests: Identify requests that require CGI handling.
Set Environment Variables: Populate the environment variables based on the request.
Execute CGI Script: Fork a new process and execute the CGI script, redirecting input and output as needed.
Interprocess Communication: Use pipes for communication between the parent and child processes.
Handle Script Output: Parse the output from the CGI script and send the headers and content back to the client.
This flow ensures that your server can handle CGI requests properly, providing the necessary environment and executing the script to generate a response.
