Setting Environment: 
Before executing the CGI script, your server must populate these environment variables based on the incoming request.

Key Environment Variables
Here are some of the key environment variables that need to be set:

REQUEST_METHOD:

Indicates the method used for the request (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Example: REQUEST_METHOD=GET
QUERY_STRING:

Contains the query string part of the URL, which comes after the ? in the URL for GET requests.
Example: QUERY_STRING=name=John&age=30
CONTENT_TYPE:

Specifies the media type of the body of the request for POST and PUT requests.
Example: CONTENT_TYPE=application/x-www-form-urlencoded
CONTENT_LENGTH:

Indicates the size of the body of the request in bytes. This is used for POST and PUT requests.
Example: CONTENT_LENGTH=27
SCRIPT_NAME:

The virtual path to the CGI script being executed.
Example: SCRIPT_NAME=/cgi-bin/script.cgi
SERVER_NAME:

The name of the server host (e.g., localhost or the domain name).
Example: SERVER_NAME=www.example.com
SERVER_PORT:

The port number on which the request was received.
Example: SERVER_PORT=80
SERVER_PROTOCOL:

The name and version of the information protocol this request came in with (e.g., HTTP/1.1).
Example: SERVER_PROTOCOL=HTTP/1.1
REMOTE_ADDR:

The IP address of the client sending the request.
Example: REMOTE_ADDR=192.168.1.1
REMOTE_PORT:

The port number from which the request was sent.
Example: REMOTE_PORT=53784
HTTP_* Headers:

All incoming HTTP headers are converted into environment variables. For example, the User-Agent header becomes HTTP_USER_AGENT.
Example: HTTP_USER_AGENT=Mozilla/5.0



Setting Environment Variables:

The setenv function is used to set the environment variables.
The first argument is the name of the environment variable.
The second argument is the value to set.
The third argument is 1, which means to overwrite the existing value if the variable already exists.
Executing the CGI Script:

The execv function is used to execute the CGI script.
It replaces the current process image with a new process image specified by the path to the CGI script.
If execv fails, it returns -1, and an error message is printed.
